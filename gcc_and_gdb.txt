a)What does the -E option mean? What does the pre-processor do
-E means only run the preprocessor. the preprocessor used to be called macro processor that does textual transformation on its input before the processing. Any input file is read into memory into many lines. continued line are concatenated into one line. and comments are taken out.

b)hello.o is object file, which is compiled but not linked. Each file is compiled but not linked together. If the file is not compiled then it is just ignored.

c)I get the a.out preprocessed, compiled, and linked

d)Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
The error is saying that they cant find main function of the program.

e)they are no error messages but when link the object file, i get
the same error as before. I am suspecting the linker final step checks 
for the existence of the main function.

3.Debugging with gdb
a)[1]    75541 segmentation fault  ./hello
it means there is a failure condition raised by hardware with memory protection.

b)Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
